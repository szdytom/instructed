# Tilemap Library

The Tilemap System used in Instructed. Generates 2D tilemaps with biomes, terrain features, and resource deposits.

## Features

- **Multi-layered terrain generation**: Base terrain (Land, Mountain, Sand, Water, Ice, Deepwater) with surface features
- **9 biome system**: Climate-based biome assignment using temperature/humidity noise
- **Resource generation**: Oil deposits and mineral clusters (Hematite, Titanomagnetite, Gibbsite)
- **Mineral deposits**: Three types of minerals generated on mountain edges in small clusters
- **Procedural algorithms**: Perlin noise, cellular automata, connected component analysis
- **Deterministic generation**: Same seed produces identical results
